Democrats do n't know how to manage money ? 
Shocking ! 
It 's amazing how Democrats view money . 
It has to come from somewhere you idiots and you signed up to foot the bill . 
Congratulations . 
This just in : pseudo scientists make claims using incomplete and insignificant data as proof- everyone believes them . 
Its like mythbusters . 
Lets use a half assed bastardized scientific process and not thoroughly test 
Great idea on the talkathon Cruz . 
Really made the republicans look like the sane ones . 
I 'm gon na go with the polar bears died and that made the water colder . 
Did you sign up for Obamacare A . 
Yesterday ? 
B . 
Today ? 
I wonder if Obamacare covers whatever it is that Carney 's smoking ? 
omg anne rand is so dumb i was really into her when i was 13 then i grew up /s 
Up next , Obama shuts down all sidewalks in the nation due to no budget . 
It 's always good to see a lying president council another lying president on how to/not to lie . 
She must have taken the Parsing Graduate Course from Bill Clinton . 
I 'm sorry , but does anyone actually believe that the Slate article is meant to be taken seriously ? 
If so , there 's some hard-hitting journalism over at The Onion that 's sure to catch your interest , too . 
huh . 
A democrat made a comment trivializing Rape and it 's not all over the news ? 
If it was a Republican it 'd be the top story on CNN and MSNBC right now . 
So when they went to private ownership , they just magically developed over night a deep knowledge of crops , animals , environment , and farming techniques ? 
From the article : & gt ; While there is a possibility that this administrator would have similarly overreacted had the employee worn a George W. Bush mask ... Bwaaaaaah ha ha haaaaah ha ha hee ho ho ooooh . 
Whew . 
Good one . 
A press release right before a long holiday . 
Surely this is n't an attempt to bury such big change in policy . 
`` the environment '' ... another strawman 
Youth uninformed about politics ? 
Since when ? 
! 
Hey man , I 'm sure you just missed the memo , but `` capitalism '' is now defined as the government telling us we have to buy something and then narrowing the definition further , by telling us we do n't know what we want and they need to show us . 
You do n't say ? 
`` Money does grow off trees , right ? `` 
-Liberal 
It 's a novel way to `` balance your budget '' . 
Appropriate for spending and then just not pay the bill . 
I like how the second poll does n't give an option to blame congressional Democrats . 
Yep this sure is a Republican Shutdown /sarcasm off 
Pity they got rid of the rainbow graph of institutionalized fearmongering . 
Obama could probably benefit from bumping it up to orange or magenta or whatever . 
Must be a `` racist '' too . 
/sarc 
& gt ; Our focus school and our Superintendent’s mandate that we improve education for students of color Then teach them what a damn sandwich is ! 
Its almost as if there is a concerted disinformation campaign trying to confuse people about Obamacare . 
who ? 
the democrats ? 
NO WAY ! 
The Nobel Peace Prize winning MESSiah would never do such a thing ! 
If this even gets to 100k , you know that some whitehouse aid will respond with bullcrap about surveillance and security and the administration 's supposed stance on the NSA revelations . 
And of course , oh yeah the book report ; education is good . 
Mainstream America wants Ed Schultz to have a heat attack on camera . 
I had no idea we had this problem with Barack until I read the same reddit article that you did . 
You mean like when his union buddies go on strike ? 
I hope it does n't need food stamps.. 
It 's bad , approval among black Americans has fallen to a “staggering” 93 . 
6 % . 
Yeah , but guys , Politifact said this was half-true . 
You just do n't understand the nuance . 
Serious you guys . 
Funny , we 're in the same category as Canada , western Europe , Australia , and Japan despite the constant comparisons to them . 
Poor Lindsey , go pickup some tissues and a bucket of ice cream and head over to John McCain 's house , I hear he 's pretty down in the dumps himself . 
Yeah , yeah , yeah , but if I dare bitch about buhraaack between bites of my turkey drumstick I 'm right back in the KKK again as far as the libtards are concerned . 
And pigs will begin flying as well . 
Because King Obama sounds so catchy ! 
So its `` Affordable '' if you lie . 
Shouldnt be too hard to do the president likes to lead by example . 
Hey if we sacrifice more to make Obamacare succeed maybe Michelle will be proud of her country for a second time ! 
! 
Stay classy Ted Cruz . 
Also , it 's not true . 
Zimmerman 's attorney invoked it throughout pre-trial and the jury was instructed to consider it by the judge before deliberation . 
But I suppose the privileged white guy has more to say about a black youths murder than the mother . 
I just tried to verify the guy 's story because catastrophic plans in other states I 've browsed were much less , but unfortunately I get an error when trying to browse plans on the CA exchange . 
http : //imgur . 
com/I7q5Zab Surely the California exchange ca n't be trashcan too , right ? 
Even the button from healthcare . 
gov that links to California exchange did n't work properly for me . 
Good thing all those social media buttons work though . 
Yeah , this is appropriate . 
Al Franken 's Senate seat is another one that should be on Republicans ' radar . 
He stole the 2008 election in Minnesota , going from a thousand votes down the day after the election to 300 votes up a few months later , after vast numbers of Franken votes kept being discovered in heavily Democratic districts . 
As economist John Lott pointed out at the time , the magically appearing votes for Franken were a statistical impossibility . 
IIRC , Franken 's team found hundreds of uncounted votes ( ! ) 
in the trunk of a Democrat operative 's car . 
That seems legit . 
/s 
so let me get this straight , they bitch and moan about having a government funded `` affordable '' healthcare system , and now that their dear leader gives them this new ability they bitch and moan they want it for free ? 
Now to top that , this so called `` bare bones '' program turns out to be a shit load of money because it is simply economically unfeasible for a social health system in this nation to be cheaper and they turn their story and now want it for free ? 
People seriously need to take some classes on economics , I guess they just think doctors and hospitals function on hopes , dreams , and unicorns . 
Hmm . 
How civil and becoming of a professional news host . 
I can see why he is so trustworth . 
A veritable beacon of righteousness . 
Seriously , I dislike Palin , but this guy is a tool bag for throwing a tantrum like that on TV . 
Details schmetails ... . 
`` Well now I 'm sorry your son was shot but in Florida if you are a pussy , you can start a fight with someone , then get scared , and pull out a gun and shoot them because you are too pathetic and fat to defend yourself like a real man. `` 
Guys did I get the gist of it ? 
We do n't believe in handouts and free rides ... ( wink wink ) 
Let me guess , President Know-Nothing knows nothing about this one too ? 
I love how as a guy , I 'm selfish for not having the resources to finance everyone 's healthcare , but they 're virtuous and kind for wanting me to finance their healthcare . 
At that particular moment , Sebelius ' underwear was functional , at a slow speed and very low reliability . 
We do n't need no education . 
But it must be Bush 's fault . 
In other news support among African Americans has dropped to a staggering 93 . 
6 % ! 
If only more people could be as sensible as Mike Rowe . 
Oh the horror of compromise and understanding of differing opinions ! 
Explaining , of course , the declining society we are building . 
This type of thinking ( while this specific article may be parody ) is exactly what is wrong with higher education . 
While diversity is nice , discrimination against anyone , including white males , does nothing but drive the educational level down . 
We desperately need engineers and scientists in the US , where we used to be the global leader . 
So a great idea , eliminate high Math and Science scores , because they are white males . 
A complete waste of oxygen in this lady . 
Obama please shut down the interwebs next . 
So people will storm DC and demand impeachment . 
darn it ! 
I knew she was right when she said she can see Russia from her house ! 
Let him be clear , No one is angrier than he is about this . 
Oh , he *might* have known , but he did n't know that he knew . 
In 6 months they will call it `` the Conservative Tea Party Healthcare and Terrorism Act '' 
Prelude to Hillary 2016 ? 
ObamaCare has failed , Hillary knows how to fix it ! 
It 's not racist if white people are the objects . 
The uber-liberal Hampshire College administration probably would n't recognize a black guy if they saw one . 
Those New England colleges are so white and so liberal , that they urinate nothing but guilt . 
That 's a huge part of the thinking of the liberal elite ; they truly know what is `` best '' for us , and if we , in our ignorance , can not understand what wonders they bestow upon us , then it is okay to manipulate or coerce us into submission . 
After all , once we figure out how amazing it is , we will all rise up and thank our benevolent betters for showing us the way in spite of our darkened minds . 
Obama was unaware that he ever said this . 
You boneheads . 
Have n't you figured it out by now ? 
It 's only acceptable to be a hypocrite if you 're a Democrat . 
But , But , he is the MESSiah , he can do no wrong ! 
If you like your lies , you can repeat your lies . 
Does n't she have better things to do ? 
Like make up pretend stories about how people in some expensive , exclusive store were racist ? 
Really ? 
Hillary 's Achille 's Heel is a conspiracy theory ? 
I thought it was her policies ... 
I think you nailed it . 
I am so convinced I am correct I can not fathom how anyone could disagree . 
I exist in an echo chamber because even hearing other perspective is so upsetting . 
In my mind , the world has a liberal bias and I skew everything to suit my views . 
I want socialized medicine , therefore hooray obamacare . 
Obamacare is a failure , therefore it was a conservative idea and Obama 's failures are all due to his strong conservatism . 
Do n't get me wrong , we are all guilty of the first paragraph to some degree , the second paragraph is an example I have seen in /r/politics to make sure we all know exactly what I am talking about . 
Alternate headline : 54 % Have Their Heads Up Their Asses . 
I ducked into /r/politics to see what they were saying about Obamacare . 
Did you know that Obamacare was drafted entirely by Republicans and forced on a poor unwilling Obama ? 
The level of delusion over there is mind-boggling . 
Wow , what a concept ! 
People looking to save money on taxes and housing ? 
Nah , ca n't possibly happen . 
And then they move to a State with lower taxes and do the same damn thing , voting to increase taxes based on bullshit ads on TV . 
Also , given your belligerence on the topic , I assume you are christian . 
Perhaps you should read the bible to discover how it feels about swearing . 
The memorial plaque above a future Obama library will simply say `` you 're racist '' 
Obama does n't really have any international clout left . 
Our allies do n't trust him and our enemies think he 's an incompetent weakling . 
That 's some fine foreign policy work there , Mr. President . 
Probably the most pitiful trend is an individual who wants to be referred to as `` they. `` 
Are we talking Legion here or what ? 
What this guy wants is single-payer . 
This part of the original was left out of the Poor Richard piece : & gt ; Supporters of Obamacare note that young people have been footing the bill for the older generation for decades through programs like Social Security and Medicare . 
You pay when you’re young and reap the benefits as you grow older . 
& gt ; Both of those programs , however , are public , with no profit motive . 
They are both funded by payroll taxes , which , when I see them deducted every month , I don’t have to worry about them being funneled to the pockets of greedy insurance CEOs through creative accounting measures . 
See , according to this enlightened liberal , the real problem here is that the ACA is n't more like Social Security or Medicare . 
Those damn greedy CEOs are the ones to blame . 
Nevermind the fact that , in all probability , there will be nothing left of Social Security by the time this 34-year-old tries to `` reap the benefits. `` 
Clearly , Oprah was embraced by white America and was so successful because people are racists . 
But libshits on reddit told me 97 % agree on global warming . 
Do n't you understand ? 
He 's a racist white hispanic ! 
I love Matthews , he 's such a dope ... lets not worry if the program is actually sound , or makes sense , its just that the left really really wanted it , so it 's bad to fight against it . 
Yeah , I 'd be real eager to hire someone who punches people for fun . 
Does n't sound like a lawsuit waiting to happen at all . 
The Obama Administration using powerful government agencies to sience dissent ? 
OMG ! 
I 'm shocked ! 
/s Some day the truth behind everything this corrupt and incompetent man-child of a President we are currently stuck with will be revealed and people will wonder how they were fooled into voting for such a monster twice . 
My insurance changed last year ( probably in preparation for this crap ) . 
Deductable is $ 3000 ( family plan ) . 
That 's for everything including prescriptions ( as in , I pay 100 % of everything , except for yearly checkups , till I hit the deductable ) . 
Earlier this month I finally hit the deductable . 
The first 9 months of the year were completely out of pocket ( though pre-tax via a HSA ) . 
My prescription is over $ 2k/90 days , though I 've made it last longer by taking a lower dose . 
Still have yet to see if things will get even worse this year . 
By the way , this is the *good* plan of the two offered by my employer . 
They should all wear Obama masks to the diversity training . 
Scientists hate him ! 
Figure out why this guy knows more about seasons than RICHARD DAWKINS . 
CLICK HERE . 
I sure hope all those single , young women who are moved to vote on the basis of free birth control will have time to maximize their promiscuity between their multiple part time , low-paying jobs . 
Please , Professor , show us the way . 
Soon . 
People care about stupid shit like this ? 
It 's actually considered some kind of victory if something this insignificant changes ? 
Damn I need to stop doing whatever the hell it is with my life and become this `` normal '' thing where such simple things are so fucking amazing . 
And just for the people wondering , yes , I 'm secretly scrooge and I hate Christmas . 
And all those other stupid holidays around the same time . 
& gt ; We just did n't realize that , unless we had health insurance at work , we 'd be the ones paying for it . 
There 's a shocker . 
Yes I 'm sure that as Ben Franklin was working the press to print news he was thinking , `` freedom of the press should be managed by the government with a list they control . 
We would n't want just anyone to be able to write stories unfavorable of the government , or revealing their corruption , that might actually empower the citizens and keep the ruthless and power hungry in check '' . 
Not . 
Way to make the tough call . 
A limp-wristed liberal . 
What a surprise . 
I ca n't believe this man is our president . 
This just in . 
Most of the people who really need health insurance , really ca n't afford it . 
News at 11 . 
Have you recovered from that ordeal ? 
Any lasting effects ?

Are there any non-religious reasons to oppose same sex marriage ? 
The bible says `` If a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood [ shall be ] upon them. `` 
It does not say that If a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them shall be denied federal benefits . 
Either get to stoning gays to death or let it go . 
Obviously , to outsource the House of Representatives . 
Where can I get my redistribution of wealth ? 
Or do I need to sign up on the website first ? 
Or we could have a nice Thanksgiving and try not to incite/participate in bickering with our families . 
I LOVE IT when Democrats look at the video of the comments they made , and still think that they can credibly claim that they did n't say what they clearly said . 
( see top comment on the link - what a dishonest loser ) 
I hate democrats , and blacks vote 98 % democrat . 
Justified racism . 
I bet you were all furious over an Iraq war whose reasons were entirely made up and sold to the public as truth . 
I really am proud of Obama . 
He 's growing more into a proper fascist every day . 
& gt ; The threat of nuclear attack by Iran ( if one exists at all ) on Israel is Israel 's problem . 
Somehow I think if a low yield nuke detonated in Tel Aviv and it was found to be Iran 's fault it would be *everyone's* problem . 
But it 's cute you 're an optimist . 
So was Neville Chamberlain . 
In other news , water is wet . 
I agree with everything that the nice lady says , but she really had no place saying it .

If you lived in the liberal echo chamber , as approximately 80 % of reddit politics people do , you 'd think the ACA was awesome , saving the lives of sick people , saving the public money , etc . 
The website thing is just an irrelevant temporary glitch and the canceled insurance policies are the fault of insurance companies , not the ACA . 
Liberal conclusion : the ACA is the best thing ever done by govt , bar none , other than electing Obama of course . 
But.. but Republicans hate black people . 
We want to `` keep them in chains '' as the wise Joe Biden told them we wanted to do to them . 
in Obama 's defense , he was extremly busy not knowing people would lose their insurance at the time 
Apologizing is kind of late do n't you think ? 
It is like in a courtroom when an opposing attorney objects and the jury is told to forget what they just heard and/or saw . 
Really ? 
The damage was already done . 
The school knew that . 
`` Hey I broke your spine on purpose and you may never walk again , but I am sorry. `` 
Of course , then again , it is Bush 's fault and I am a racist . 
I mean ... it skyrocketed day 2 though to 248 dude ( even though I thought it was 100 day 2 and 248 by day 3 but who knows ) . 
I mean look on the bright side , Jay Carney said only 5 % of americans lost their insurance . 
Only 2 million so far ! 
That 's pretty good ! 
And with 20 million needing insurance and with forbes estimating only at least 93 million will lose their grandfather status , that 's a pretty good trade . 
Who cares if they estimate more people will lose their coverage in the long run than people who needed it from the start . 
Now they can just go on Obamacare and *save them monies* . 
I mean sure , people 's premiums are doubling for worse plans . 
Those are just the bad plans we got ta weed out . 
And unfortunately responsible people , that includes your bad cadillac plans as well . 
You guys really do n't know how lucky you were that the government found this before it was too late . 
Can you believe you guys were only paying a little and getting a good policy ? 
It makes more sense to pay a good amount for a little policy because good is better than a little right ? 
/s I could keep going for a while but I think i 've circlejerked enough 
Color me shocked , the IRS being used as Obama 's personal muscle . 
He should be more firm with the House Republicans . 
Tell them that this time , he drew a *maroon* line . 
That 'll scare 'em . 
Just a minor detail . 
`` The Nobel Peace Prize is so relevant for present discussions of world affairs '' -No one ever 
Just gon na throw this idea out there : Maybe , just maybe , the importance of a day should n't be judged by whether schools are open on that day . 
I think some people here are trying too hard to be offended . 
Yea imagine that ! 
That is a world I do not want to live in . 
Good thing that never happens ... Phew . 
What will they cover instead ? 
Shitting in Sarah Palin 's mouth ? 
Fear mongering from the liberals ? 
who would have thought ? ! 
? 
What if his `` religious beliefs '' dictated that black people were sub-human ? 
Is that cool with all you guys , too ? 
Yeah , further divide the party . 
That 'll work . 
I 'm certain that these numbers are false . 
It 's unfair to judge Obama like this just because he 's black . 
Let him affirmative-action^doctor the numbers first , then judge him . 
Should n't this be posted in /r/HollywoodactorswhousedtoloveObamaproblems ? 
I 'm having trouble mustering up any compassion for her or the rest of the morons there . 
Clearly this young boys policy should have included maternity care and abortion pills . 
Since it did n't , the insurance company was just ripping him off with a junk policy . 
Shame on these 1 % fat cat corporations . 
I thought that the high up government officials were exempt 
There was too many trans-fats in the vegetables of course . 
What 's he at now ? 
145 rounds or something ? 
He must have named every blade of grass . 
In short , we 're just being racist/sexist . 
You should also mention this is only black on white . 
Actually black on anything . 
But wait white guys are racist ! 
What the Fuck happened to this country . 
& gt ; `` third-parties '' You spelled Hillary Clinton wrong . 
In other liberal news , butter crust bread is now to be considered sexist . 
So who is running the country ... . 
What ? 
He 's been elected before ! 
I thought you had to be newly elected and filled hopey changey promises ... 
You forgot that any opinion other than that the sun physically shines out of the dear leader Baraks ass gets you audited and put on a terrorist watchlist 
I love the butthurt tone of that `` news '' story . 
Gave me a good laugh anyway . 
In a post-racial , color blind society , why ca n't he pretend to be a Samoan transgendered quadriplegic if he wants ? 
Problem liberal `` news reporter '' ? 
I love it . 
Let me be perfectly clear , enforcement discretion of that incorrect promise shall proceed maybe . 
Congress makes budgets ? 
Since when ? 
Have n't seen one in a few years . 
Granted , this is really funny , but do we really have to be dicks ? 
I really do n't want this to turn into an /r/athiesm Facebook `` owning '' circle jerk . 
We get it . 
You 're smarter than your friends on Facebook . 
Congrats . 
I only hate his white half . 
There 's that famous liberal `` civility '' again . 
So in 2006 Al Gore said we had 10 years left to save the planet . 
What does everyone plan on doing with the remaining 2 years , 57 days , and 15 hours we have left ? 
Imagine if Congresspeople left their state because they did n't get what ... . Oh . 
Way to vet a story , NewsBusters . 
Does anyone research this shit or do they not give a damn anymore about journalistic integrity ? 
Those racist rules of grammar . 
When will white people learn that you ca n't just expect minorities to write and speak correctly ? 
Oh nooos , not Mark Levin . 
I 'm sure Obama is shaking in his boots right now . 
Levin needs to just shut up since it is thanks to Cruz listening to him and the rest of the radio talk show crowd that we got in this shutdown mess . 
Yes , they knew , they just hoped they would n't be the ones whose rates would go up . 
So you get what you deserve ... . enjoy . 
I like how the only thing he is worried about is that the Republicans want to get rid of the program that `` put Obama in the history books '' . 
Matthews really has a creepy obsession with the President . 
Let 's forget the fact that this is costing jobs , ruining the economy , and actually HURTING people 's healthcare . 
Disgusting . 
Or they 're using those emotional words to try and sway public opinion and hence pressure the republicans into caving . 
But that could n't possibly be it right ? 
It 'd be one thing if they were saying the republicans were pussies that were n't going to follow through - that 's taunting - but they 're not . 
This does n't equate . 
WARNING : actual leadership may be imminent . 
Proceed with caution . 
But seriously , so far it looks like Obama blinked . 
So he must have been worried about his approval ratings ; in addition , he must see an opportunity to exploit . 
I did n't read the part where Bill Maher donated time nor money .

Although apparently accusations about benghazi are the same as accusations of pedophilia . 
Politicians indulging in nepotism ? 
Say it ai n't so . 
To be fair , W caught hell for perceived nepotism , Obama should too .

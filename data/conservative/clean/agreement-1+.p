I am neither old nor white, but I think there\'s plenty of room in the Republican Party for values-voters who are firm in their convictions and believe that an age-old, hallowed vestige that has survived for over a millenia - and is, as Pat Buchanan would have it, the cinderblock of every good civilization - should not be reconstructed or demolished without so much as the batting of an eyelash. \n\nFor every Jon Stewart-worshipping, dope-smoking millenial we mesmerize with our modernistic, reinvented, "new and improved" charms, we lose a folksy, tradition-revering, flag-waving Hank Hill or Charlie church-going, evangelical Christian.  Is this shallow-minded, shortsighted, moral degenerate really going to allow the Cultural Marxists, who have already been permitted to hijack every major institution in sight, to frame the debate for us, rather than fight in the trenches for the divinely ordained, sacrosanct moral order that holds society together?  \n\nThere\'s a reason heteronormative marriage has withstood the test of time: dual gender parenting - a mom and a dad - provides a balanced, "best of both worlds" approach to the upbringing of our youth.  It sows the seeds and lays the groundwork for ordered liberty, civil government, and moral restraints on the insatiable appetite for avarice and sin.  It is where division of labor, separation of responsibilities, disciplinary action against unruly behavior, unwritten codes of conduct, a rugged work ethic, self-sufficiency, and self-governance originate.  It is a sanctimonious and wholly organic institution.  \n\nMen and women, though it is not some unwavering biological imperative in all cases, are genetically and biologically different - mothers typically being more nurturing, empathetic, and emotionally in-tune, and fathers typically being more stringent - stressing achievement, discipline, and hard work above all else.  Fathers are generally more geared toward what\'s rational and this-worldly, mothers toward what\'s spiritual and transcendent.  \n\nMost people who favor traditional marriage do not do so out of a deep-seated animus for those who deviate from the natural order: the Westboro Baptist Church and its devotees are but microbacteria in a petri dish.  They don\'t even claim the conservative mantle, in any case.  They are not our titular spokesman, nor do they represent us.   Religious and conservative leaders of yore have, for the most part, affirmed for themselves that marriage is between a man and a woman: Ronald Reagan, Pope John Paul II, G. K.  Chesterton, and C. S.  Lewis.  \n\nWe needn\'t wilt or capitulate before the mob: Biblical truths and inviolable institutions are forever - much more important than elections, ambitions of power, prestige, or social acceptance.'

a(S'As a Libertarian, I don\'t like the free pass that this post implicitly gives to Reagan and GWB.   When measuring the percent increase in the national debt, the Reagan and GWB administrations\' stewardship of the debt was unconscionable.   The debt was $1. 142 trillion on the date of Reagan\'s first budget (beginning of Fiscal Year 1982), and it was $2. 857 trillion at the end of his last budget, for a percent increase of 150%.   For GWB, $6. 228 at the start and $13. 562 at the end, for a percent increase of 118%.   As for Obama, $13. 562 at the start and $17. 204 currently, for a percent increase of 27% (but he is only responsible for 4 fiscal years so far).   [Source](http://useconomy. about. com/od/usdebtanddeficit/a/National-Debt-by-Year. htm)\n\nDick Cheney told Treasury Secretary Paul O\'Neill, ["You know, Paul, Reagan proved that deficits don\'t matter.  We won the mid-term elections, this is our due. "](https://en. wikiquote. org/wiki/Dick_Cheney#On_the_economy).   \n\nBottom line, pointing fingers about the debt is a losing argument for Republicans.   The best thing to do would be to stop talking about it, sweep it under the rug, and make sure it never happens again.   I mean, can you imagine if Obama was on track to increase the debt to $33. 905 trillion?!   That\'s what it would take to be the equivalent of what happened under Reagan.   \n\nI disapprove of just about everything Obama and the Democrats are doing these days, but accuracy is important.

a(S'The percentage you raised debt in absolute terms is meaningless and misleading.  It\'s easy to see why this fails if you replace "debt" with "income".  Imagine Reagan\'s gets a huge 118% raise going from $11,420/yr to $28,570/yr, while Obama\'s only gets a meager 27% raise going from $135,620/yr to $172,040/yr.  If Obama was as good as Reagan and got a 118% raise he would be making $339,050/yr. \n\nComparing spending or debt to GDP is more legitimate.  As a percentage of GDP, Obama is spending more than Reagan.  As a percentage of GDP, debt increased by about 20% under 8 years of Reagan.  Under Obama has already exceeded that.  See graphs below:\n\n[Spending to GDP percentage](http://www. usgovernmentspending. com/spending_chart_1792_2014USp_15s1li011lcn_F0f) Also, notice before FDR and the new deal, federal spending was about 2. 5% GDP except during wars.  Since WW2 is has averaged about 20%. \n\n[~~Spending to Debt~~ Debt to GDP percentage](http://www. usgovernmentdebt. us/spending_chart_1792_2016USp_15s1li011lcn_H0f_Accumulated_Gross_Federal_Debt)\n\nAlso, Reagan was working with a Democrat controlled House, so the situation was basically reversed of what it is today with regard to spending.  \n\nFinally, saying that because Republicans have increased debt they can\'t criticize Democrats for doing it is wrong and dangerous thinking.  The parties change every year as values change and politicians get replaced.'

The model\'s accuracy is based on this margin of error.  As a result of measuring the accuracy of a model, you can go back and update working theories and create new models.  This is how science works. \n\nFurthermore, the entire concept of global warming is based on a few very simple facts. \n\n* CO2 and other "greenhouse" gasses capture more infrared radiation (generated by the sun or other sources) than air. \n\nThis can be scientifically measured using simple experiments: http://www. espere. net/Unitedkingdom/water/uk_watexpgreenhouse. htm\n\n* Human activity pumps millions of tons of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere every year. \n\nhttp://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions\n\n* The earth is a closed system, similar to the glass boxes in the experiment above. \n\nTherefore, based on the simple experiment, we would expect to see some increase in temperature on a global scale as a result of human behavior.  \n\nThe predictions and ramifications of this warming are much more difficult to figure out due to how huge and complex the world is.

No matter where that line is drawn, there will be people who feel they are getting something they don't want or need and others who feel something absolutely essential has been left out. \n\nI suppose existing plans could have been grandfathered in, but every plan changes at least a little bit every single year.  How much change should be allowed before the plan needs to be brought up to code?  Also, what happens if 90% of the participants switch to one of the new plans.  Now the risk pool is gone and the price of the plan will skyrocket because the insurance company has no other way to pay for coverage of the remaining members.  (Old plan, old rules)"

The point of these kinds of contracts is that it streamlines the procurement process - when work needs to be done, they issue a Task Order under the IDIQ contract and any of the certified vendors can bid on it. \n\nSo when the Healthcare. gov project came up, a Task order for the work was created, and according to records, 4 of the certified vendors bid on it.   [CGI Federal\'s bid of $93. 74M was the one selected](http://www. scribd. com/doc/176565745/CGI-Contract). \n\nCGI Federal got on the IDIQ contract in 2007, the classmate joined CGI Federal in 2010, and CGI Federal won the task order in 2011. \n\nI highly doubt that the classmate had anything to do with CGI winning the task order - she certainly had nothing to do with the company getting certified on the Medicare IDIQ contract.'

"\n\nThe funny part is that the system WAS doing that prior to the Obamacare intervention.   Older people typically have greater assets and accumulated wealth.   If they needed or *wanted* to spend more on healthcare, they were most capable of doing so.   The young and healthy should have been saving their money for retirement and *healthcare* so that when they got older, they too had money put aside.   This system robs from the poor to give to the rich.   That\'s the real irony.   \n\nIncreasingly, there is a penalty for saving.   The government wants to be the arbiter of who gets what.   Consequently, this is going to result in more of the behavior that\'s killing us.   Instead of saving for retirement/healthcare, it becomes advantageous to spend your money as quickly as you can.   Otherwise, your "wealth" excludes you from government support.   As it stands, you can save and do without the benefits of spending all your income (new boat, toys, vacations, etc) and then when you retire you\'re supposed to pay again to support others on the money that you saved.   Alternatively, you can spend everything and enjoy it now.   When you retire, expect someone else to pay up.   It\'s a perverse incentive.'

Imagine if people were lobbying for prohibiting unwed mothers from ever getting married!

It honestly took me by surprise, because up until that point everything he had said seemed sympathetic to the House and Republicans.  This is exactly what the rest of the press is doing right now, running defense for the Democrats and pinning the blame, unfairly and inaccurately, on the House and Republicans."

I\'m all for putting money to helping our earth, if we care about all of our politics and whatever, why don\'t we care about our earth.  But I actually was watching Al Gore\'s An Unfortunate Truth a few years back and to me, the data actually looked like "Yes, there was global warming" but also that it wasn\'t severe.  \n\nFor example, one of the most prominent parts of the film, Gore uses data from 500-700 years ago compared to now in terms of temperature.  There\'s only 1 problem.  500-700 years ago was the middle of a miniature ice-age.  There\'s also another problem.  If you graph the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere with the total amount of people living in the world, you get a ridiculously similar curve.  (Even when population goes down CO2 goes down) So perhaps the increased CO2 levels are less a pollution problem and more a population problem.  Do note we have so much more people in the world now than ever before.  Who is to say that once the population levels off the CO2 won\'t follow?  The concept of global warming (heat being trapped in our atmosphere through greenhouse gases) is most likely correct, but what I would argue is actual cause of global warming.  Of course, I will always support limiting pollution, it\'s just that I would rather have the whole truth, not just the parts of it that are inconvenient.'

a(S"I looked into this. \n\nWhen the ACA was enacted, existing plans were grandfathered in.  You could keep your old plan, even if it didn't conform to any of the new regulations (coverage for pre-existing conditions, no denial of care for specific conditions, mandated coverage of hospitalization costs etc) UNLESS the insurer changed the plan as it was in 2010 in any of a variety of ways, including increasing premiums, decreasing percentage of premiums returned in care, decreasing employer contributions, and others.  Of course, in the three intervening years, almost every plan has had a premium increase of some kind, so unless your plan was a) already compliant or b) not compliant but *almost entirely unchanged* from 2010, you'll need to get a new plan. \n\nI'd call it 'half true,' because you would be allowed to keep the plan from 2010 unless the insurance company changed it, but the law was written in such a way that it was essentially impossible for an insurance company to avoid losing grandfather status on its plans.  On the one hand, it's unfortunate that plans people were happy with are no longer valid, but on the other, it would've been impossible to accomplish the goals of the ACA (comprehensive care for all Americans) if noncompliant, noncomprehensive plans had been grandfathered en masse."

I am too lazy to look up the numbers for Bush Junior, but you know he didn't care at all about the budget deficit. \n\nBut I do agree that it would be much better if we did not have the underlying drivers of the deficit.  Here I am specifically talking about the unpaid expenses which were not forced (unlike the fall in revenues from the 2008 crisis, say), specifically the very unfunded Medicare part D expansion, the unfunded wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Bush's unfunded tax cut for the rich.  There is simply no excuse for such ridiculously spendthrift non-Conservative policy.  To see how the current debt and deficit had looked without these factors, look at http://i. bnet. com/blogs/cbppchart2. png from [cbsnews](http://www. cbsnews. com/8301-505123_162-43554480/wake-up-america-spending-and-tax-cuts-wont-save-the-economy/).

Plus, the ACA specifically says that they can't ration healthcare.  \n\nNow, it is allowed to adjust reimbursement to providers starting in a few years, which could decrease the number of providers that take Medicare.  It should also be noted that CMS (the administrative body that runs Medicare) adjusts reimbursement already; obviously a government-run healthcare plan will have reimbursement set by the government.  Additionally, the person who heads that is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate (just like the members of IPAB).  It seems like the IPAB won't really have any new abilities other than their recommendations are legally binding if Congress doesn't do anything (which, let's face it, is the probability).  That could be a concern. \n\nAnother major difference is that, previously, the main body that makes recommendations to CMS is an [AMA-sponsored committee, RUC](http://www. ama-assn. org//ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/medicare/the-resource-based-relative-value-scale/the-rvs-update-committee. page).  CMS doesn't have a mandate to accept their recommendations, but [HealthAffairs found that CMS accepted ~87% of this committee's recommendations](http://content. healthaffairs. org/content/31/5/965. abstract? sid=6b650a54-26fe-4474-98a9-d8945f8e692e).  It is mostly comprised of specialists, which brings up conflict of interest issues and makes it more likely that primary care doctors make far less money than specialists, contributing to the lack of primary care physicians.  An interesting Washington Post article noted that the RUC's estimates of time spent on procedures was [grossly overestimated in some cases](http://www. washingtonpost. com/business/economy/how-a-secretive-panel-uses-data-that-distorts-doctors-pay/2013/07/20/ee134e3a-eda8-11e2-9008-61e94a7ea20d_story. html? tid=pm_pop).  On top of all of this, their proceedings are private.  Theoretically, IPAB would be public (though we've heard that claim made before by the government - not always with satisfaction). \n\nWant to read about IPAB yourself?  [Hop on over to section 3403. ](http://housedocs. house. gov/energycommerce/ppacacon. pdf)\n\nTL;DR: the question is: should the government have more of a role in deciding how much they pay, or should a private committee from a medical interest group comprised of specialists have the greater role in influencing payments?"

The EPA has become yet another accursed tentacle of Obama's campaign of executive overreach just like the IRS, NSA, CIA, etc.  It would be nice to attempt to tweek market incentives to realize some of the external costs of pollution but Obama can't conduct his cronyism that way.  As a result any environmental protection efforts turn into heavy handed half baked paternalistic policies with a huge serving of government money to his campaign toadies in the private sector.  Even if the charlatan in chief were tomorrow start acting like a president and not some arrogant five year old it would be to late.

There is another budget showdown, Republicans offer the same deal.  Same thing the next year, etc. \n\nThird, because a compromise usually means both sides are giving up something or getting something.  In this case, the Democrats will give in to a 1 year delay if the Republicans give into what?  Funding the government?  Doesn\'t that imply that the Republicans don\'t want to fund it in the first place, but are willing to do so if the Democrats give in to the Obamacare delay?  \n\nI made this analogy in another post: It is like you going to a car dealership and the dealer saying "So, you give me $20,000 and I give you nothing. " When you refuse and say lets make a reasonable deal, they say "Fine fine.  You give me $10,000 and I give you nothing.  Yay compromise!

He's not your friend, you don't know him personally.  Bush gets called W.  to differentiate him from his father but also out of disrespect.  Reducing someone to one letter.  (my opinion).  Still, I don't understand why people call him Barack.  \n\nAlso, the common core is garbage.  The majority of what they're forcing on teachers is garbage.  I'm all for the personal responsibility it puts on teachers.  You'll really see a change in schools in the next few years with the common core and some other changes coming to teacher prep programs.  I think the majority of these are for the better, especially the extended standards for states who didn't have them before.  \n\nThis is the take home point, and it's a reflection on how education works in this country and why it is broken.  We get a great idea (or at least some people thing it's great), these ideas are becoming more and more research based (i. e.  IDEA, NRP, RTI).  We go all in on these ideas all at one time.  Small pieces of them are broken.  Instead of fixing the small crack, we replace the whole dam.  Which starts the cycle all over again.  We're currently putting more emphasis on teacher responsibility for student outcomes, which is great.  However, this isn't appropriate for all students and some teachers will have good outcomes when they don't deserve them and others will have poor outcomes when they deserve positive ones."

a(S"I may be misinterpreting it, but the amendment to the Free Flow of information Act doesn't have to deal with the Freedom of the Press so much as it has to deal with protecting sources.  That is, the amendment would state that only \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d journalists would not have to give up their sources if subpoenaed.  Other, \xe2\x80\x9cnon-official\xe2\x80\x9d journalists will still be able to publish material without repercussion, but may have to give up the identities of their sources. \n\nI am torn on this, in that I think the concept is not inherently wrong but the implementation is unacceptable.  Protection of sources is key to Freedom of the press, whistle-blowers should have a reasonable expectation of anonymity if they leak their information to the press, and otherwise nobody would ever do so.  The bill in its current language protects most major news sources, but seems to severely limit most investigative and freelance journalists who should receive the same protections as classical journalists and reporters. \n\nThe problem comes from giving the ability to protect sources to anyone and everyone.  If I start telling you military secrets, and you decide to publish them to Facebook, you can say you are acting as a member of the press with me as your anonymous source.  I am not entirely sure that you should be able to do that, otherwise there would essentially be no repercussions for leaking classified information.  \n\nI think that the poor language of the amendment stems from journalists and the press being one of those things where you can\xe2\x80\x99t define it but you \xe2\x80\x9cknow it when you see it\xe2\x80\x9d.  With the rapid advance of technology, there are a lot of people, including bloggers, who should be classified as journalists today, but who didn't exist as journalists in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s mind 10 years ago.  There are also those who cannot reasonably be portrayed as journalists, and thus they probably should not receive the same protections as journalists.  This amendment is an attempt, albeit an extremely poor one, to differentiate between the two."

This is how current abortion laws are defended: The autonomy of the individual.  \n\nIf, however, another human is connected to me and I accept that, but I don\'t take care of myself - to an extreme degree.  I\'m in a position to do that same actions, but without the goal of terminating the connection with the other individual.  I might just end up damaging the other individual, and then leave others to pick up the pieces when the process is complete.  In a pregnancy setting this will mean increased chances for birth defects - mental and physiological problems.  In another medical setting this would mean damaging instead of helping another individual.  \n\nIn this last setting there is some very practical reasons for a control organ coming in and saying "now, wait a minute, the path you\'re headed down now is very problematic" - Here you\'ve already rejected your right to autonomy, which is what abortion laws are predicated upon, but you are now damaging someone else.'

a(S"One of my biggest pet peeves is that people don't recognize who the real culprit is.   An example: recently Venezuela has had a shortage of toilet paper.  Instead of recognizing that the economy can't sustain the high taxation, lower taxes, and wait for the market to correct the problem itself, as lower production costs would incite more manufacturing, bring more jobs, and make the product more available; the Venezuelan government simply raided the toilet paper factory and blamed the US (inexplicably). \n\nIn this case, rather than accept the impasse, realize the Republicans have some power to demand some of their demands, the Obama administration is flat out blaming Congressional Republicans, and taking the initiative to shut down unnecessary venues, such as the generally unmanned WWII monument, and also self-sustaining park areas. \n\nThis is calculated destructiveness, and it's walking a dangerous line.   So many people (like myself) are screaming that these unnecessary and capricious shut-downs are nothing more than political intrigue, since they don't cost enough to be worth shutting down (or sometimes even make money for the government).  If the fence-sitters hear us instead of the standard media talking points, it'll be extremely destructive to the liberal cause. \n\nBut the active injure and blame-shift makes me aggressively ill.   It's complete and outright lies, and even a cursory view of the facts bear my theory out."

Sure Barack was a nice fellow, they said.  But white voters would never vote for a black president.  Other angry voices were raised.  Barack\xe2\x80\x99s former pastor called the country a failure.  God would damn the United States for mistreating its black citizens, he said. \xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt seems like the author is stating that some "third-parties" **thought** Obama could not be elected because the majority of Americans are racist, which turned out not to be true.   The author doesn\'t claim in this passage that white voters rejected Obama because of race, just that some individuals thought white voters would reject Obama because of race. \n\nHowever, I could see where this could be misinterpreted by grade-schoolers or "spun" by a teacher.'

I have two daughters and I will never have any sons because I've had a vasectomy.  So it's in my best interests, for the sake of my children, to do the best I can to make sure they go forth into a world that is equal and fair to them.  That being said, I think we've achieved that as a society already.  In my opinion we've actually gone a little too far past that where now women are getting paid more than their single male counterparts in the same age bracket as well as the disparity between male and female college students.  This teaching women that they are perpetual victims isn't going to lead my daughters to a happy and fruitful life if every time someone is mean to them they put the blame on 'the patriarchy' and not where it actually belongs.  Instead of confronting or fixing the problem they'll attack this abstract notion of some system engineered specifically for their oppression. \n\nIf you get called fat it's not because everyone is trying to oppress you, you can fight the patriarchy by putting up your body acceptance pictures on tumbler and feel like you've made a difference or you can start leading a healthy lifestyle and hit the gym until you are not fat anymore. \n\nIf you get passed up for a raise at work you can go home and fume about how it's the patriarchy oppressing you or you could improve your chances by upping your game - hell find a better job if you want!  But instead feminism will tell you it's an invisible system holding you back and instead of you changing yourself you need to make them change and adapt to you.  In the end it assigns blame to the wrong thing and is counterproductive.  Living life as a perpetual victim with everything being everyone else's fault that you can't succeed is a convenient excuse not to ever try and better yourself."

a(S'Full transript of his remarks: \n\nOn a late September day in 1787, the Constitutional Convention finished its work.  As Benjamin Franklin walked down the steps of Independence Hall, a Philadelphia woman named Elizabeth Powell stopped him and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Doctor, what have we got: a republic or a monarchy? \xe2\x80\x9d\nHe responded, \xe2\x80\x9cA republic.  If you can keep it. \xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFor more than two centuries, we have kept our republic because Americans have understood that our liberty is protected by our laws and by a government of limited powers. \nOur Constitution provides for checks and balances so that no one person in power \xe2\x80\x93 so that no one political party \xe2\x80\x93 can hold total control over the course of our nation. \n\nBut now, in order to break down the separation of powers and ram through their appointees to the judicial branch, President Bush and the Republican leadership want to eliminate a two-hundred-year-old American rule saying that every member of the Senate can rise to say their piece and speak on behalf of the people that sent them here. \n\nThe fact is that this President has a better record of having his judicial nominees approved than any President in the past twenty-five years.  Only ten of 214 nominations have been turned down. \nSo it is clear that this attempt to strip away these important checks and balances is not about judges.  It is about the desire for absolute power. \n\nBut our nation\xe2\x80\x99s basic rules are there for the moments when the eyes of the powerful grow large and hungry; when their willfulness makes them determined to do whatever it takes to win, and prevail at whatever the cost. \n\nPresidents and parties have grown drunk with power before.  Two Presidents of my own party \xe2\x80\x93 Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt \xe2\x80\x93 began their second terms of office with majorities in Congress and then tried to change the rules governing judges so that they could stack the court with those who would do their bidding.  They were wrong to try to change our basic American rules \xe2\x80\x93 and Americans, and Senators of both parties, stood up to tell them so. \n\nToday, another attempt is being considered to rewrite the rules so that those in power can get their way. \n\nIt would mean that the U. S.  Senate becomes merely a rubber stamp for the Executive Branch. \n\nIt would mean that one political party \xe2\x80\x93 be it Republicans today or Democrats tomorrow \xe2\x80\x93 gets to have all the say. \n\nIt would mean that one man, sitting in the White House, has the practical ability to personally hand out lifetime jobs to judges whose rulings can last forever. \n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s not how America works. \n\nHere, in America, the people rule \xe2\x80\x93 and all the people have a voice.  We pledge allegiance to \xe2\x80\x9cone nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all. \xe2\x80\x9d Not liberty and justice for whoever may be in the majority of the moment.  Liberty and justice for all.  In America, everyone gets their say and their due. \n\nToday, we say to the American people: if you believe in liberty and in limited government, set aside your partisan views and oppose this arrogant abuse of power.   Our freedom as a people was purchased by soldiers and Senators, by those who fell for our country and those who rose to speak for it, even when they stood alone.  The courage of patriots has given us a republic.  Now, it is our task \xe2\x80\x93 and our test \xe2\x80\x93 to show that we can keep it. \n\n-Harry Reid, 2005 http://democrats. senate. gov/2005/03/15/reid-statement-on-nuclear-option/'

In fact, the percentage of eligible blackvoters in 2012 who voted was higher for the first time in history than the percentage of eligible white voters who voted.  In addition, Romney figured he would need 60% of the white vote to win, he did not hit 60% of the white vote and in addition only got 2% of the black vote.  \n\n3) Her diminished popularity since supporting Obama probably ties to Obama's diminished popularity.  It's simple correlation (yes i'm aware that correlation does not prove causation, i'm not stating it does).  At this point, Obama is not very popular for various reasons, e. g. , NSA surveillance, libya, IRS, and failed healthcare rollout.  \n\nSimple answers that make perfect sense, nothing you said makes her comment any less true.

Why did Virginia have to ratify a state amendment to thwart local communities from sponsoring government-established religions, and why was prayer such a ritualistic fixture of early congressional gatherings?

a(S"Here is what I do not understand: Reid and Obama say the Republicans are irresponsible and reckless, controlled by extremists, and that the tea party members are anarchists and terrorists.  Reid and Obama say they want all or nothing, a clean CR bill.  But let us suppose that what Reid and Obama say about the tea party is true, that the minority group of extremists are dug in, suicidal and don't care about getting reelected and don't care if they bring down the whole GOP with them.  If this is the case, if Reid's namecalling and posturing *is actually true*, maybe even true without him knowing it, then what can the Democrats hope to acctually accomplish with all these insults and media hounds and blames and feels and dictates? \n\nSuppose Boehner simply cannot get the votes to support a clean resolution.  What do the democrats want him to do?  He cannot force the tea party to vote at gun point.  Threats from the democrats won't change the tea party's mind.  Back stabbing from bipartisan and centrist republicans won't change the tea party's mind.  So there simply are not the votes for a clean cr.  And nothing the democrats or republicans can say will change this. \n\nSo if this is the case then it is *irrational* for the democrats to insist with their all or nothing demands.  if you demand all or nothing and there literally is no possible way to get all then you necessarily get nothing.  Sure the tea party may be extremists and all get voted out in 2014 and sure the gop may completely collapse, but in the meantime the democrats **get nothing**.  \n\nIf the Democrats are rational, then they would take the piecemeal funding offered by the republicans, because 'all' *is not possible* but 'some' *is possible*, and some is better than nothing.  Lets agree with Reid that the tea party is irresponsible and reckless, fine the tea party is irrational and america will most likely vote them all out in 2014 fine, but if the Democrats insist on nothing for nothing's sake then *they too are irrational*."

To ignore that fact invites the folly of liberal utopianism wherein we are told to entrust benevolent government officials to manage the system, as if they were not themselves selfish and corruptible.  Capitalism depends on selfishness.  It is the worst economic system--except for all others.  Capitalism works though, because it relies on the selfishness of both the vendor and the consumer to strike a balance.  The vendor wants to get the most compensation for his product and the consumer wants to get the most value.  Sure an altruistic system would be better, but the problem is no one has ever found this incorruptible, benevolent, altruistic leader to manage it all for us.

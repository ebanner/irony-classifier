p1039
I-1

a(V  What you describe is Obama's ideal solution for healthcare.
p1041
I-1
tp1042
a(V  He didn't bother trying for single payer because he knew it would most likely die.
p1043
I-1

a(V A few days ago something was posted regarding her husband, Bill Clinton, saying that people should be able to keep their plan if they want to.
p1107
I-1
tp1108
a(V Now I think that this is a clear tactic used to try and separate Hillary from the Obama administration  without them saying she is against them.
p1109
I-1
tp1110
a(V Now the trick is that she is not really against him, rather, she is being the typical dem and abandoning ship to benefit herself.
p1111
I-1
tp1112
a(V Im calling it right now, there will be a rather subtle divide between her and the Obama admin.
p1113
I-1

a(V\u000a\u000a&gt;As the only socially transformational legislation in modern American history to be enacted on a straight party-line vote, Obamacare is wholly owned by the Democrats.
p1169
I-1
tp1170
a(V Its unraveling would catastrophically undermine their underlying ideology of ever-expansive central government providing cradle-to-grave care for an ever-grateful citizenry.
p1171
I-1
tp1172
a(V\u000a\u000a&gt;For four years, this debate has been theoretical.
p1173
I-1
tp1174
a(V Now it\u2019s real.
p1175
I-1
tp1176
a(V And for Democrats, it\u2019s a disaster.
p1177
I-1
tp1178
a(V\u000a\u000a&gt;This is the signature legislative achievement of the Obama presidency, the embodiment of his new entitlement-state liberalism.
p1179
I-1
tp1180
a(V If Obamacare goes down, there will be little left of its underlying ideology.
p1181
I-1
tp1182
a(V\u000a\u000a&gt;Perhaps it won\u2019t go down.

tp1190
a(V\u000a\u000a&gt;Perhaps.
p1191
I-1
tp1192
a(V The more likely scenario, however, is that Obamacare does fail.
p1193
I-1
tp1194
a(V It either fails politically, renounced by a wide consensus that includes a growing number of Democrats, or it succumbs to the financial complications (the insurance \u201cdeath spiral\u201d) of the very amendments desperately tacked on to save it.
p1195
I-1
tp1196
a(V\u000a\u000a&gt;If it does fail, the effect will be historic.

p2453
I-1
tp2454
a(V The first thing they did was put 200 of us in a room with a line on the floor.

p2463
I-1
tp2464
a(V\u000a    \u000aWhen it was finished they said before you graduate you will stand on that other side of the line.

a(V It was complete indoctrination, and they were madly obsessed with it...
p2467
I-1
tp2468
a(V even to the point of ridiculing those who stood on the side of opposing abortion to the whole room.
p2469
I-1
tp2470
a(V It left me and many others noticing judging stares the entire rest of the day.
p2471
I-1
tp2472
a(V It immediately made groups of people ignore / avoid those on the other side of the line they chose earlier that day.
p2473
I-1
tp2474
a(V Again that was in 1991.

p2493
I-1

p2515
I-1
tp2516
a(V Now to top that, this so called "bare bones" program turns out to be a shit load of money because it is simply economically unfeasible for a social health system in this nation to be cheaper and they turn their story and now want it for free?
p2517
I-1
tp2518
a(V People seriously need to take some classes on economics, I guess they just think doctors and hospitals function on hopes, dreams, and unicorns.

a(VGood.
p2567
I-1

I-1
tp2610
a(V  \u000a\u000aThey jumped to a few conclusions.
p2611
I-1
tp2612
a(V  Since I vocally opposed the boycott I must hate gays and be opposed to gay marriage.
p2613
I-1
tp2614
a(V  While I don't have a problem with gay marriage, I do oppose the state recognizing same sex marriage, with the addendum that I think the state needs to butt out of all marriage.

a(VI looked into this.
p4393
I-1
tp4394
a(V\u000a\u000aWhen the ACA was enacted, existing plans were grandfathered in.
p4395
I-1
tp4396
a(V You could keep your old plan, even if it didn't conform to any of the new regulations (coverage for pre-existing conditions, no denial of care for specific conditions, mandated coverage of hospitalization costs etc) UNLESS the insurer changed the plan as it was in 2010 in any of a variety of ways, including increasing premiums, decreasing percentage of premiums returned in care, decreasing employer contributions, and others.
p4397
I-1
tp4398
a(V Of course, in the three intervening years, almost every plan has had a premium increase of some kind, so unless your plan was a) already compliant or b) not compliant but *almost entirely unchanged* from 2010, you'll need to get a new plan.
p4399
I-1
tp4400
a(V\u000a\u000aI'd call it 'half true,' because you would be allowed to keep the plan from 2010 unless the insurance company changed it, but the law was written in such a way that it was essentially impossible for an insurance company to avoid losing grandfather status on its plans.
p4401
I-1
tp4402
a(V On the one hand, it's unfortunate that plans people were happy with are no longer valid, but on the other, it would've been impossible to accomplish the goals of the ACA (comprehensive care for all Americans) if noncompliant, noncomprehensive plans had been grandfathered en masse.

p4411
I-1
tp4412
a(V   In truth we should have reverted to deficits in the low hundred billions and with the withdrawal from Iraq  (orchastrated by Team Bush) and draw-down in Afghanistan we should be close to surplus.

p4689

p4749
I-1

a(V  Redefining marriage to mean any relationship makes the concept of marriage less serious.
p4751
I-1
tp4752
a(V  Another reason for gay marriage is for liberals to go after religion.
p4753
I-1
tp4754
a(V  Gay activists, who always have a liberal political agenda, have sometimes admitted this.
p4755
I-1
tp4756
a(V  European countries with gay marriage have seen less straight marriages and more out of wedlock births.
p4757
I-1
tp4758
a(V  While gay marriage makes gay people feel good and is popular with young people (so is Miley Cyrus), it serves no productive value to advancing a civilized culture.

p4761
I-1
tp4762
a(VOn the contrary, if Republicans would just run someone who had a damn clue how to put together a solid platform, they would be unbeatable in 2016 because Obamacare will be in full effect (assuming it ever gets fully implemented) and the whole country will be suffering as a result.
p4763
I-1
tp4764
a(V\u000a\u000aKeep in mind that current day Obamacare started out as Hillarycare during the 2008 campaign season, which Obama actually opposed but had to settle for once he was elected because Democrats in Congress wouldn't pass what he originally wanted.

p4791
I-1

a(VYeah, just some info here (correct me if I am mistaken, folks): the IPAB can only act if Congress can't get their shit together enough to control Medicare expenditures themselves and override the IPAB's suggestions, and there's only so much savings they are allowed to enact per year.
p4793
I-1
tp4794
a(V Plus, the ACA specifically says that they can't ration healthcare.
p4795
I-1
tp4796
a(V \u000a\u000aNow, it is allowed to adjust reimbursement to providers starting in a few years, which could decrease the number of providers that take Medicare.
p4797
I-1
tp4798
a(V It should also be noted that CMS (the administrative body that runs Medicare) adjusts reimbursement already; obviously a government-run healthcare plan will have reimbursement set by the government.
p4799

a(V Additionally, the person who heads that is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate (just like the members of IPAB).

tp5160

p5161

p5163

p5171
I-1
tp5172
a(V\u000a\u000aThird, because a compromise usually means both sides are giving up something or getting something.
p5173
I-1
tp5174
a(V In this case, the Democrats will give in to a 1 year delay if the Republicans give into what?
p5175
I-1
tp5176
a(V Funding the government?
p5177
I-1
tp5178
a(V Doesn't that imply that the Republicans don't want to fund it in the first place, but are willing to do so if the Democrats give in to the Obamacare delay?
p5179
I-1

a(V \u000a\u000aI made this analogy in another post: It is like you going to a car dealership and the dealer saying "So, you give me $20,000 and I give you nothing.

a(V (my opinion).
p5301

I-1

a(V \u000a\u000aAlso, the common core is garbage.
p5305
I-1
tp5306
a(V The majority of what they're forcing on teachers is garbage.
p5307
I-1
tp5308
a(V I'm all for the personal responsibility it puts on teachers.
p5309
I-1
tp5310
a(V You'll really see a change in schools in the next few years with the common core and some other changes coming to teacher prep programs.
p5311
I-1
tp5312
a(V I think the majority of these are for the better, especially the extended standards for states who didn't have them before.
p5313
I-1
tp5314
a(V \u000a\u000aThis is the take home point, and it's a reflection on how education works in this country and why it is broken.

p5331

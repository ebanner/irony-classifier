If you can keep it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nFor more than two centuries, we have kept our republic because Americans have understood that our liberty is protected by our laws and by a government of limited powers. \\nOur Constitution provides for checks and balances so that no one person in power \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so that no one political party \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can hold total control over the course of our nation. \\n\\nBut now, in order to break down the separation of powers and ram through their appointees to the judicial branch, President Bush and the Republican leadership want to eliminate a two-hundred-year-old American rule saying that every member of the Senate can rise to say their piece and speak on behalf of the people that sent them here. \\n\\nThe fact is that this President has a better record of having his judicial nominees approved than any President in the past twenty-five years.  Only ten of 214 nominations have been turned down. \\nSo it is clear that this attempt to strip away these important checks and balances is not about judges.

They were wrong to try to change our basic American rules \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and Americans, and Senators of both parties, stood up to tell them so. \\n\\nToday, another attempt is being considered to rewrite the rules so that those in power can get their way. \\n\\nIt would mean that the U. S.
